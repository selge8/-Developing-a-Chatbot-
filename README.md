# Database Chatbot Assistant (Northwind + Gemini + Gradio)
This project is an AI-powered chatbot assistant that enables users to query an SQLite database (Northwind.db) using natural language (English or Turkish). It converts the user's query into a valid SQL statement using Google Gemini, executes it on the database, and presents the results in an interface built with Gradio.
